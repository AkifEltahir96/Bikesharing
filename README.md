## Summary

  In summary, we find that males are more likely to use Citibikes in comparison to females and those of an unknown gender. Also, Citibikes are mostly used in the early morning (6 - 9 am) and evenings (5 - 7 pm) on weekdays and consistently throughout the day during typical daytime hours (9 am to 5 pm) on weekends. In addition, most Citibike users are suscribers to the program. This information is crucial because it supports the idea that Citibike users are loyal users. Loyalty to the program may be due to convience, accessibility, and overall enjoyment of the Citibike program. 
  Two additional visualizations for further analyses include determining which age groups use the Citibikes most frequently and what locations people are travelling from and to with the Citibikes. These analyses will provide data on who is more likely to use Citibikes and what kind of areas (urban, suburban, residential, etc...) should Citibikes be placed if they were to be in Des Moines, Iowa! This data will help further convince investors that investing in a Citibike program in Des Moines, Iowa will be good for their bank accounts!
